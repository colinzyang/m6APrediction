\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA sequences. All sequences must be of the same length.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each column represents a nucleotide position.
}
\description{
Converts a vector of DNA sequences into a data frame of factors suitable for machine learning models.
Each position in the sequence becomes a column with factor levels A, T, C, G.
